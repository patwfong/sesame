How To Make Lemon Meringue Pie<br>
<br>
I was intrigued by a recipe for &quot;The Best Lemon Meringue Pie You&#39;ve Ever Had.&quot; Luckily, it was the day before Mother&#39;s Day, so I thought I would take a crack at it. The recipe called for the following ingredients: white sugar, butter, and eggs. I wrote the list and went to the store.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I saw a notice in the window of the supermarket that every bag of white sugar had already been sold.<br>
<br>
&#45; Rats, I exclaimed, and crossed white sugar off the list. Then, I entered the store to buy butter and eggs.<br>
<br>
As I passed the dairy section, I saw that the refrigerator had broken. All of the butter was melted together into a humongous, lumpy, yellow mass.<br>
<br>
&#45;  Well, that&#39;s just great, I muttered, and crossed butter off the list. I pushed my cart along to buy eggs.<br>
<br>
It was outside the egg section that I remembered the announcement I had heard on CNN the previous night. All chickens were on strike and were refusing to lay eggs until farmers met their demands. So, there were no eggs in the supermarket.<br>
<br>
&#45; Just my luck, I told myself, and crossed eggs off the list. <br>
<br>
So, I bought a pre made lemon meringue pie from the bakery. My mother told me it was the best lemon meringue pie she had ever had.<br>
