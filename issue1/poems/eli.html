Any Way You Can Get To The House<br>

The temperature bottlenecked at 8:00, after chorused swallows, the room becoming freezing and burning at either ends of the hour. The aesthetic overwhelmed the critical. 72 pounds of exploded styrofoam caught fire and did not stop burning until the firemen arrived. Set into the mouths of chairs like cats in heat, like petroleum. Said one: &quot;This is how a canyon is made.&quot; There is gangrene in the A/C and questions: &quot;Do cats have ankles?&quot;, &quot;I was just imagining Jennifer Lawrence with a dick.&quot; There was so much horseshit in the room, you could hit it with a stick. We were talking about ourselves talking about ourselves talking. We lunched in the chaos. Playing ping&#45;pong: the net was fraying and it dipped in the places where we had come close to each other. We were drying up in basements, on deserted, walkable roadways. I&#39;ve been trying to worship something wet. Icebox watermelons drilled open with long fingernails. There can be no elegy for something without architecture. Here was a big thing for our small lives. The basement was freezing. The aliens needed steam for their ship so we gave them all we could. We rhymed our charity because it was hilarious and that&#39;s what the situation permitted. We boiled tennis shoes, cashews, shoots of bamboo. The fire rushed downstairs, down steps. Fire descended on the house and the house descended into water and ash. The fire was a church and the water was fire. We overcame the water.<br>
