gauting<br>
<br>
it was a country of castles, i decided:<br>
Schloss Herrenchiemsee and Oberhaus and Hofberg and Passau,<br>
mine yellow where Neuschwanstein was pink,<br>
overlooking my kingdom.<br>
<br>
the oceans of wheat&#45;gold and up&#45;blue were mine, see,<br>
because their paths were my bike&#45;width and a half<br>
and even when they were white and unfamiliar<br>
they were still mine because when i went fast enough<br>
the v&#45;shaped sledding hill pushed me back up the other side.<br>
<br>
and the forest was less mine because it was no&#45;one&#39;s,<br>
but the leprechauns hid gummi&#45;bear gifts in the moss for me<br>
on the stump&#45;tables so i knew i was welcome.<br>
<br>
in my kingdom, my endless mysterious four&#45;square&#45;mile bike&#45;radius,<br>
i was run&#45;happy singsongy daydreamy because<br>
the tadpoles did my bidding and the trees remembered<br>
my openings and the birdwatcher built me a hut to read in,<br>
and the summers were strawberries<br>
blackberries gooseberries cherries and redcurrants.<br>
<br>
i think i was fuller then but maybe it was because<br>
i was small and easier to fill and the swing in the<br>
back of the backyard let me fill in my extra spaces with the sky.<br>
<br>
but i left my country of castles before i got to be queen of the school&#45;bus<br>
before the dried&#45;fruits man stopped giving me chocolate orange rinds<br>
before i found out the truth about the gummi bears.<br>
<br>
i left my country of castles without saying goodbye to the tadpoles<br>
or to chessie the chestnut tree or to old Herr Werner,<br>
assuming they&#39;d have no reason not to be there when i came back.<br>
<br>
i left my country of castles, promised hollywood and disneyworld<br>
and American normalcy, which i thought i wanted.<br>
<br>
i learned that kids don&#39;t really know how to share what&#39;s<br>
already theirs and i don&#39;t care much for Spanish architecture.<br>
<br>
another family moved into my yellow castle and put<br>
the furniture in all the wrong places and let<br>
their daydreamy children grate snowballs<br>
into parmesan on the mesh metal table<br>
and roam my magic world.<br>

only they didn&#39;t get to leave it, intact<br>
before the magic crept out of the kingdom<br>
and got jumbled with the brand&#45;new<br>
busy&#45;ness that turned them<br>
upside down and emptied the sky all out.<br>
