Untitled<br>
<br>
i eat sorrows, just admit you got em<br>
one day jeff discovers a different reich,<br>
from his books and his looks, to the bottom<br>
of a bottle i hold to his mouth like<br>
<br>
a mother to her babe, i know what you <br>
crave, to wade into a sea of nothing,<br>
keeping time to splashes of glassy blue...<br>
dunk, breath, spit&#45 the brain is now aborting<br>
<br>
yearning to escape never ending wait<br>
for life explained ideologically<br>
he sins, is it a predetermined fate<br>
i am artificial happy intrinsically<br>
<br>
don&#39;t listen to them jeff i dont harass<br>
everyone wanna make love to the glass<br>
