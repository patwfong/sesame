Hill<br>
<br>
Gabriel thought he was lucky. Sam believed it was a sign from the fates.<br>
<br>
As the two youths walked down a quiet road early morning, they couldn&#39;t help but feel like they were saved. The party had lasted into the early hours of the morning, until some farmer called the cops. Every gathering of youths had recently been shut down due to calls from farmers. Slightly intoxicated, the boys sighed strong sighs of relief. Ever since the fire at another party two months ago, all students found at chaotic house parties were to be &quot;relieved of studying&quot; immediately. With five warnings between the two boys, getting arrested would have been the end of their respective worlds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Goddamn,&quot; Sam said. &quot;How the hell did you know they would bust in so fast?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Some chicks were gossiping downstairs. Even if it wasn&#39;t true, I didn&#39;t want some hick to be my downfall. So, just luck I guess,&quot; Gabriel said.<br>
<br>
The road was a well worn dirt path. The city council promised to pave it dozens of times, but nothing ever happened here. There were rocks here and there and occasionally the somewhat inebriated young men had to overcome these tremendous obstacles. Gabriel wanted to get home. Sam thought he was on the path to heaven.<br>
<br>
The boys came upon a paved road. <br>
<br>
&quot;Civilization, I have arrived,&quot; murmured Gabriel. <br>
<br>
&quot;Shame we couldn&#39;t get a ride,&quot; replied Sam, but he didn&#39;t really mean it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh we could have,&quot; chuckled Gabriel. &quot;It just might have some lights on the top.&quot; He sighed, &quot;I need a cig man, you got any?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know I don't. When are you gonna get off that?.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter now. There's a liquor store up the road, let's stop there.&quot;<br>
<br>
With no desire to resist his friend, Sam nodded and they continued along their way. A car roared by the boys. Sam knew the driver, but he didn&#39;t mention it to Gabriel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Store is just up here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure enough, gaudy neon lights lit up the road ahead, and the two walked through the parking lot.<br>
<br>
&quot;How are you going to buy anything? You&#39;re under aged&quot;, questioned Sam pensively.<br>
<br>
&quot;They don&#39;t care here. They don&#39;t need to see a card, just money.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabriel had a way of answering Sam&#39;s questions that answered them completely, yet left nothing resolved for Sam. Gabriel needed a smoke. Sam felt an air of emptiness.<br>
<br>
The door of the shop opened with a ding, and Gabriel walked up to the counter to talk to the employee. Sam walked through the aisles of high fat food, and by the large fridges that contained drinks that Sam imagined could not be found anywhere else. He kept watch on Gabriel from behind a shelf of chips. Gabriel was talking in an urgent hushed voice, though it didn&#39;t sound like the two were in disagreement. Sam watched as Gabriel tilted his head back and ran his fingers through his hair.<br>
<br>
Gabriel called his name from the front. &quot;Want anything?&quot;. Sam tried to act like he hadn&#39;t been watching.<br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;m fine, thanks&quot;, Sam replied. &quot;Can we just get out of here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, sure. You can wait outside if you want.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sam stepped outside and felt a cold that he must have missed before. With vapor rising at every breath, he looked up. There was barely a sliver of a moon, and the world was very dark apart from the harsh red and green neon signs of the store. Gabriel walked out after several eternities. Sam wasn&#39;t exactly nervous without him, but he didn&#39;t feel completely comfortable with him gone. A cigarette was lit and the two continued on their way. Gabriel had his cigs. Sam had hisguide.<br>
<br>
The pair walked down the road for another half a mile until Gabriel told Sam that they could cut a lot of time if they took a shortcut across the field on the right of the road. Sam didn&#39;t really want to cut any time, but agreed with a meager &quot;sure Gabe.&quot; Gabriel finished his first cigarette and threw it to the ground. Another one was promptly lit.<br>
<br>
The dirt in the field was horribly dry and all of the plants were dead. There had been much less rain than the average year, and it brought a sort of gloom over a town that had never been happy to begin with. <br>
<br>
&quot;Agh,&quot; voiced Sam. &quot;Smells like shit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course it does. Don&#39;t you know where you are? Ain&#39;t exactly a metropolis.&quot;<br>
<br>
They continued to traverse the seemingly infinite field. With the packed in dirt, it was unlikely they were even making footsteps. The boys kept a casual conversation about the things they had seen and done at the party, though it was difficult to remember. Both had had more to drink than they had anticipated. Sam noticed that Gabriel seemed a little distant, but after such a close brush with expulsion it was hardly surprising. On Monday they would hear the full horror stories of their classmates.<br>
<br>
After about halfway through the field Gabriel told Sam he needed a break and the two sat down amongst the dead plants. Gabriel was exhausted. Sam was anxious.<br>
<br>
&quot;I could have been out of there,&quot; sighed Gabriel. &quot;Out of school, out of my life. My parents man, they&#39;d kill me. I need this, I need to graduate. They&#39;ve tried so hard, my parents, to give me a chance. And here I am fucking it up.&quot; Gabriel began to cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Gabe, we got out of there in time,&quot; as hard as he tried it was hard to console him. It was even harder to see him this sad.<br>
<br>
&quot;What if we hadn&#39;t man? We&#39;d be out. All of my parents&#39; work, for nothing.&quot; A third cigarette was lit. &quot;I need to change. I need to change my goddamn life. This path is gonna kill me. I need to change Sam.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then we can change. We don&#39;t have to go to every party, we can show up to class&#45;&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No Sam. Everything needs to change. No parties period. No cutting class period. It&#39;s fucking over.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok Gabe. We can change. Of course we can change.&quot; Gabriel cried silently next to his friend. Sam&#39;s stomach felt like a knot.<br>
<br>
After a while he stopped. The two sat there in the quiet of the night in the field of dead plants.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Sam,&quot; Gabriel told Sam. &quot;Thanks for understanding, and... just being there&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course Gabe.&quot; Sam could feel it. This was his moment.This is when Gabriel would feel it. This is when he would understand. <br>
<br>
&quot;Gabe, I ... I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Love you too man&quot; Gabe uttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;No Gabe. I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabriel understood.<br>
<br>
<br><center>&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;</center>
<br>
The lack of moon did wonders to the stars. They danced and danced above the field. Every constellation imaginable floated endlessly through the frozen air. Light pollution from the city up north was non&#45;existent at this point. It was at a point where it was too late, yet at the same time too early to see Venus exude its beauty to its neighbor earth. With a particularly keen eye, one could even see the center of milky way. They all hovered with an ethereal lightness that is impossible to explain to humans. So permanent yet changing. In their greatness all problems on earth seemed so small at that moment to an onlooker, but to young men in the dirt of a dead field, the heavens were merely decorations.<br>
<br>
Gabriel got up. In an unspoken language of pity and guilt, he told Sam it was time to go. Sam sat for another second, and then the two continued their journey across the field.<br>
<br>
On the other side of the field a wide road awaited them. They walked next to each other, but each of them were distant and cold. Gabriel was giving up. Sam already had.<br>
<br>
The remaining part of the walk was quiet, at least to ears. Inside the minds of the young men thoughts thrived and burned.<br>
<br>
Though quiet the boys&#39; presence was transmitted to each other. They were completely aware that the other was there and it didn&#39;t make them feel any better. Sam held back tears in his throat with all of his strength. Gabriel was so zoned out that he tripped over a rock lying in front of him. Normally, the boys would have laughed. The only noise made was a grunt by Gabriel during the fall.<br>
<br>
After another bout of silent march they arrived in their neighborhood. From the direction they were coming, Gabriel&#39;s house was closer. They walked up to the front door together. Sam was ready to perform the speech he had practiced in his head over and over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gabe, I&#39;m sorry. I don't want this to change our friendship. I had to be honest. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m a goddamn dumbass and I should have kept my mouth shut.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It&#39;s... uh... ok man. I&#39;m glad you could feel comfortable enough to tell me.&quot; Gabriel had no words to explain how he felt. He barely knew how he felt himself. In the end, he decided that he felt scared. &quot;I just can&#39;t love you that way though. We will still be friends, but nothing will ever happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks. Really thank you.&quot; The tears were about to tear his throat open.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah... sure man&quot; Gabriel said. He paused for a moment to compose himself. Sam was about to speak, but Gabriel cut him off. &quot;I need to go now. Goodnight.&quot;<br>
<br>
The too embraced each other strongly. Gabriel was the first to let go. He walked away and snuck into his house via an open window. Sam walked to his house and did the same. They had made it home.<br>
<br>
Gabriel was getting a migraine. Sam was beginning to cry.<br>
