<br>
I was cutting onions so much that I cried.  I accidentally chopped off my fingers.<br>
They are a pile of colored thread on the ground.<br>
Dark black blood and wine stain what used to be light and tan.<br>
My arms that are stubs try to pick up thin slices of thread...<br>
and smelly onion (Clean the kitchen, Sarah. Keep it spotless).<br>
<br>
I need someone to make me whole again&#45; someone who can sew.<br>
I see my grandmother&#39;s deep wrinkles and sagging hands.<br>
She even goes as far as to thread a needle but she turns to wisps quickly,<br>
suddenly. I whisper my problems to dissolved air,<br>
and I gasp and sob when I realize she&#39;s not there.<br>
<br>
My dad, the engineer, has arrived to make me whole.<br>
He carefully twists his needle until my limbs are complete again.<br>
Six fingers on one side, four on the other!? I am lopsided and my dad didn&#39;t know<br>
better.  Slowly, painfully, we unthread me, we unwind me but too far.<br>
All that is left is a pile of thread and two eyeballs for seeing and a mouth for yelling.<br>
<br>
I shriek and I scream but my dad goes to work and leaves me<br>
alone on the floor (next to the onions!)<br>
All I can see are sinews (plus onions!)<br>
My eyeballs for seeing are crying (but maybe it&#39;s just the onions!).<br>
My mouth for yelling is dry&#45; it swallows thread (and onions!).<br>
<br>
My eyeballs and my mouth and my body which is thread<br>
lay helpless on the ground.<br>
My sister comes by and puts my eyes on top of me<br>
and my mouth under that.<br>
But I can&#39;t move away from my spot on the floor,<br>
next to the onions (they are intertwined with me; we are one).<br>
