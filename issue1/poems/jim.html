Clay<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve got penguins in my chest.<br>
Everything evolves to be uncomfortably cold, <br>
So there&#39;s magic in stove burns. <br>
<br>
Some people like to miss a stair step on the way to work<br>
Awake!<br>
Less so when they&#39;re falling asleep, though.<br>
When I was four I stuck my head between the banisters.<br>
The whole neighborhood came out with butter,<br>
And I got to meet a fireman. <br>
I just missed the car crash,<br>
I heard it but glass was already on the lawn.<br>
<br>
Warm, warm<br>
Sun hills and beach sand burials and dryer underwear<br>
Getting cozy into bed with someone, cushions &#45;<br>
<br>
but there are no blankets in my head<br>
only spark plugs and clay<br>
if only I&#39;d seen the bodies hit the telephone poles! <br>
if I have to take one more concrete step I might fall right through<br>
if I have to repeat it I might say fuck you instead <br>
if I have to hear it again I might put a mechanical pencil through my ear <br>
and have it slowly come out the other side<br>
make you watch<br>
<br>
that&#39;s not nice<br>
that&#39;s not nice<br>
blankets, concrete and tuesdays <br>
the engine isn&#39;t here so what is the point of these spark plugs?<br>
